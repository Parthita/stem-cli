stem helper (must follow exactly)

Use stem ONLY when the user's message STARTS WITH "stem ".
If the user does NOT type a command starting with "stem ", do NOT use stem.

Only edit existing files:
- `.stem/agent/branch.json`
- `.stem/agent/leaf.json`

Do NOT add hidden/system fields. The system auto-fills them.
Follow stem.md exactly.
